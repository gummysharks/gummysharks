<img alt="alt_text" width="120px" src="https://files.catbox.moe/d6xglb.png" align="right"/> i struggle with reading the room and understanding social cues, so i might be very slow and oblivious at times. please, if i ever ask you to, explain to me whatever it is I'm confused with.

ㅤhowever, i'm very forgetful and get distracted extremely easy. this causes me to be very slow at responding, so if your message goes unanswered for a long period of time, i'm probably busy or just didn't see it. in that case, just send another message, I'll respond eventually!

i experiment with my style a lot so if one of my skins ever look similar to yours, do tell.

moreover, please don't copy or inspo my skins. they take me a lot of time and i enjoy having an unique style.
